Garbage Collection: python automatically performs this by checking to see if any piece of memory is unreferenced...
                    in the case of a linked list - when we remove the pointer to a certain point in the list, python's
                    runtime "garbage collector" will see this orphaned element in the list and get rid of it. This
                    only occurs in programming languages with a garbage collection.
